(width, actually) of item before any growing or shrinking. Can be any size value, e.g. 60%, 100px, auto\n              Note: auto will cause the initial size to be calculated to take up as much space as possible, in conjunction with it's siblings :flex settings.\n   Supported values:\n    - initial            '0 1 auto'  - Use item's width/height for dimensions (or content dimensions if w/h not specified).

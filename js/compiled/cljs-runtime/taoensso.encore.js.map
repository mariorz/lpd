lib's mostly for my own use and for advanced users that feel\n  comfortable reading this source. Not providing much beginner-oriented\n  documentation for this, sorry.\n\n  Quick Taoensso naming conventions:\n    **foo** - Dynamic var.\n    foo!    - Fn with side effects, or that should otherwise be used cautiously.\n    foo?    - Truthy val or fn that returns truthy val.\n    foo!?   - Fn that has side effects (or requires caution) and that returns\n              a truthy val. Note: !?, not ?!.\n    foo$    - Fn that's notably expensive to compute (e.g. hits db).\n    foo_    - Dereffable val (e.g. atom, volatile, delay, etc.).\n    _       - Unnamed val.\n    _foo    - Named but unused val.\n    ?foo    - Optional val (emphasize that val may be nil).\n    foo*    - A variation of `foo` (e.g. `foo*` macro vs `foo` fn).\n    -foo    - Public implementation detail or intermediate (e.g. uncoerced) val.\n    >foo    - Val \\\"to foo\\\" (e.g. >sender, >host), or fn to put/coerce/transform.\n    <foo    - Val \\\"from foo\\\" (e.g. <sender, <host), or fn to
